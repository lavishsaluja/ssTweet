[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

### About
ssTweet is a twitter bot which can upload the screenshot of every tweet in a thread made by the original author to your Google Photos account.

I maintain a [To do](./to_do.md) list for all the tasks that I have to complete.

### Contribute
Here are the [Set Up](./set_up.md) instructions for anyone who might want to set up the project on their local machine. If you find my code not following the [coding standards](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) or anything that could have been done in a more pythonic way, I would love to hear from you. Please raise an issue or submit a pull request.
